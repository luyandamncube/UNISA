## MAT3707 - Discrete Mathematics: Combinatorics
- This was a module I completed while studying at the University of South Africa.
- [Introduction to Discrete Mathematics](https://github.com/luyandamncube/UNISA/tree/master/year2/MAT2612) is the predecessor for this subject
- This subject covers graph theory and applied combinatorics

## Resources
