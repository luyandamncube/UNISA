# UNISA

## APM2611 - Differential Equations
- This was a module I completed while studying at the University of South Africa.
- [MAT1613 Calculus B](https://github.com/luyandamncube/UNISA/tree/master/year2/MAT1613) is the predecessor for this subject. 
- This is a difficult subject. Would highly recommend having STRONG knowledge of Differentiation + Integration from MAT1613. 
- Again, practice and revise all the methods of  Differentiation + Integration thoroughly. They are used in depth for solving DE's

## PDE's 
- It was helpful to have done [MAT2615 Calculus in higher dimensions](https://github.com/luyandamncube/UNISA/tree/master/year2/MAT2615) before this. Topics that helped with PDE's included partial differentiation, gradient vectors and methods of legrange.
- [Standford](https://web.stanford.edu/class/math220a/handouts/firstorder.pdf) has a great handout to understand PDE's

## ODE's
- [Paul's online notes](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/DE/DE.aspx) was a good introduction to topics in this subject
- MathbyLEO has a good in depth video on [First Order ODE's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFpT-Ptmkyg)

## Other topics
- The organic chemistry tutor has a good video explaining [Direction/Slope Fields](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wr9VOum9Co0)
