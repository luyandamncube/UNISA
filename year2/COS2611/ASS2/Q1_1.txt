a   valid   assignment operator

b   valid   link pointer of list is assigned the value of the link pointer of A

c   valid   list->info refers to a valid member of the struct nodeType

d   valid   list-> is the next node
            list->link is the next node 
            therefore, list->link->info refers to the info of the next availible node
            (double arrow operator)

e   valid   assignment of the dereferenced pointer B to the address of A

f   valid   A->link refers to the next node 
            therefore, A-link->info refers to the info of the next availible node
            (double arrow operator)

g   valid   assignment of the info in node B to info in node B

h   valid   B refers to node the first node  
            B->link refers to the second node  
            B-link->link refers to the third node 
            therefore, the statement assigns the third node of B to list

i   valid   B refers to node the first node  
            B->link refers to the second node  
            B-link->link refers to the third node 
            B-link->link->link refers to the fourth node
            therefore, the statement iterates to the fourth node
