# UNISA

## MAT2615 - Calculus in Higher Dimensions
- This was a module I completed while studying at the University of South Africa.
- [P. Danziger](https://math.ryerson.ca/~danziger/professor/MTH141/Handouts/vectors.pdf) has a great handout explaining vectors in Rn
- [Desmos](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/ksjcpazwa9) provides the ability to graph parametric equations
- [Krista King](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLJ8OrXpbC-BM2TBMW9g--nTY-sG-SSAZC) has an excellent playlist that goes through the logic/syntax and examples for this subject 

### Assignment 1
* [Vectors & Planes in Rn, Parametric Equations, Quadric Surfaces, Partial Differentiation, Epsilon-Delta definition](https://github.com/luyandamncube/UNISA/tree/master/year2/MAT2615/ASS1/ASS1.pdf)

### Assignment 2
* [Applications of Derivatives,Integration](https://github.com/luyandamncube/UNISA/tree/master/year2/MAT2615/ASS2/ASS2.pdf)

### TODO (finish these notes before exam)
- Parameterizing a curve C
- Parametric Equations of Parabolas
- Optimization (Using Language multipliers)
- Regions (Type I, Type II)




### Exam
- All the above concepts tested
