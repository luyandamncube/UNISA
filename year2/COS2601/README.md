## COS2601 - Theoretical Computer Science II 	
- This was a module I completed while studying at the University of South Africa.

## Resources
- [NESO Academy's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58N2N7zJGrQ&list=PLBlnK6fEyqRgp46KUv4ZY69yXmpwKOIev) playlist on youtube was a great source for a crash course on this topic
- [JFLAP](http://www.jflap.org/jflaptmp/) provides a way to quickly design, convert, minimise and test the output of FA. It is probably the most useful software in this course:

- [Ravindrababu Ravula](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBwx2PVicTY)  also gives a great lecture on Kleene's theorem (how to convert RE to TG and vice versa)
