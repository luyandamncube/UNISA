## MAT2611 - Linear Algebra II
- This was a module I completed while studying at the University of South Africa.
- MAT1503 is the predecessor 
- [TrevTutor](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDDGPdw7e6AjJacaEe9awozSaOou-NIx_) has a really comprehensive video playlist covering most of the topics in this subject. He gives a very good fundamental explantion of each topic which should help when attempting questions. I recommend watching EVERYTHING corresponding to topics from the study guide.
