### Resources
- [Oscar Veliz](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLb0Tx2oJWuYIAReeSPDbqY1QvcjTUToNq) has an excellent playlist going over the Solutions of Equations in One Variable (Bisection method, fixed-point iteration, newton's method, miller's method etc)

### Resources: calculators
- [atozmath](https://atozmath.com/CONM/Bisection.aspx?q=mu&q1=x%5e4-2x%5e3-5x%5e2%2b12x-5%60%60false%603%2c1%2c2%604%601%603&dp=4&do=1#PrevPart) has a calculator with the various methods used in this subject
- This can be a tedious subject. Highly recommended to build your own programs that will work as checks against answers. An example of this was a calculator I made use python for [Naive Gaussian Elimination](https://github.com/luyandamncube/UNISA/blob/master/year2/COS2633/GaussianEliminationWIthoutPivoting.py)
- Another example of some python programs [here](http://www.math-cs.gordon.edu/courses/mat342/python/gauss.py)
