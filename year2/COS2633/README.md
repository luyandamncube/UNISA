# UNISA

## COS2633 - Numerical methods
- This was a module I completed while studying at the University of South Africa.
- [atozmath](https://atozmath.com/CONM/Bisection.aspx?q=mu&q1=x%5e4-2x%5e3-5x%5e2%2b12x-5%60%60false%603%2c1%2c2%604%601%603&dp=4&do=1#PrevPart) has a calculator with the various methods used in this subject
- This can be a tedious subject. Highly recommended to build your own programs that will work as checks against answers. An example of this was a calculator I made use python for (Naive Gaussian Elimination)(https://github.com/luyandamncube/UNISA/blob/master/year2/COS2633/GaussianEliminationWIthoutPivoting.py)
