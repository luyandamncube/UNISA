# UNISA

## MAT2612 - Introduction to Discrete Mathematics
- This was a module I completed while studying at the University of South Africa.
- [COS2661 Formal Logic II](https://github.com/luyandamncube/UNISA/tree/master/year2/COS2661) is a great subject to complete before this one as most of it's syllabus (Logical Statements/Arguments, Logical Possibility, Truth Tables, Conditional Statements, Quantifiers, Rules of Inference) is revision for MAT2612
- [madebyevan](http://madebyevan.com/fsm/) is a great tool for drawing diagraphs quickly in this subject
- The [Mississippi counting problem](https://medium.com/i-math/can-you-solve-the-mississippi-problem-6c0f3b02531) (Multinomial theory) is a big section in Counting in this subject. Make sure you understand this THOUROUGHLY. Otherwise, the questions where you need to arrange words/digits will seem abastract.

# Resources 
- Counting (Kimberly Brehm) - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEDCPR67jqU
- Permutations + Combinations (miberly Brehm) - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1m9sB5XZQc
- [This video](https://slideplayer.com/slide/8569093/) is probably the best to learn how to represent relations using diagraphs/matrices
- [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iWlsp55N_s) gives a great explanation of Induction Inequalities
- [Trefor Bazett](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLHXZ9OQGMqxersk8fUxiUMSIx0DBqsKZS) provides a great playlist for discrete mathematics including revision for this subject
- [WolfRam](https://demonstrations.wolfram.com/HasseDiagramsOfIntegerDivisors/) provides an excellent tool to draw Hasse Diagrams of Integer Divisors (Dn)
